# Stochastic-opt-assignement

## Purpose
Integrated healthcare scheduling focuses on coordinating resources across multiple services within a single healthcare system.
The optimization problem under consideration addresses three key challenges in healthcare: surgical case planning, scheduling of patient admissions, and assigning nurses to rooms.
The purpose of the code is to enhance and optimize patient flow throughout the hospital’s various departments and facilities. 
We solve the problem by using the implemented  Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP). The goal of this search method is returning a solution which should be both feasible and it should minimize the objective function. It repeatedly applies local search from different starting feasible solution.
The objective function is defined as the weighted sum of all soft constraint violations. Each soft constraint corresponds to a desired but non-mandatory condition in the hospital setting. When these constraints are not fully satisfied, a penalty cost is incurred. The objective is to minimize the total cost, thus achieving a solution that best respects these preferences while maintaining feasibility.
It is important to note that the GRASP solver relies on local search techniques, which means there is no guarantee that the solution found is a global minimum.
